# Project Overview

## Purpose
This is a progressive React/Next.js learning repository structured as team lessons. The repository teaches React concepts incrementally through multiple steps/stages.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15.1.7** with App Router
- **React 19.0.0** with modern functional components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript configuration** (though files use .jsx/.js extensions)
- **ESLint** with Next.js core-web-vitals config
- **Prettier** for code formatting

## Learning Progression
Each step is a complete Next.js application that builds upon previous concepts:

1. **step01_react1**: Introduction to React components and basic Next.js setup
2. **step02_react2**: Props and component communication
3. **step03_hooks**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback)
4. **step04_create_nextjs**: Next.js creation process
5. **step05_nextjs_app**: Additional Next.js application development

## Repository Structure
- Each step directory contains its own complete Next.js project
- All steps use the same dependencies and configuration
- Japanese comments and content for educational purposes
- Standard Next.js 13+ App Router structure with `app/` directory
